# Data Structures in Swift

This project is about Implementing of common data structure in Swift. The data structures implemented in this project include:

- [Stack](https://github.com/loyihsu/Data-Structures-in-Swift/tree/master/Stack)
- [Queue](https://github.com/loyihsu/Data-Structures-in-Swift/tree/master/Queue)
- [Singly Linked List](https://github.com/loyihsu/Data-Structures-in-Swift/tree/master/Linked%20List/Singly%20Linked%20List)

I am still working on implementing an increasing number of other data structures, so the list will grow.

## How to use it?

Each data structure is implemented in a single Swift file. Just include the Swift file in your project and you are ready to go.
