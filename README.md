# Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift

This is a project including implementation practices of common data structure & algorithms in Swift.

## Data Structures

The data structures implemented in this project include:

- [Stack](https://github.com/loyihsu/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift/tree/master/Data%20Structures/Stack)
- [Queue](https://github.com/loyihsu/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift/tree/master/Data%20Structures/Queue)
- Linked List
  - [Singly Linked List](https://github.com/loyihsu/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift/tree/master/Data%20Structures/Linked%20List/Singly%20Linked%20List)
