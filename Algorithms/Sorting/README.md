# Sorting Algorithms

The sorting algorithms are implemented as an extension to `Array`. To use the sortings, add the file to your project and use it directly on your array.

For instance, to use `bubbleSort()`:

```swift=
var myArray = [2,1,3,5,4]
myArray.bubbleSort()		// The array would be updated to the sorted array (with bubble sort).
```
